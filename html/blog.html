        	CNNs have broken the mold and ascended the throne to become the state-of-the-art computer vision technique. Among the different types of neural networks (others include recurrent neural networks (RNN), long short term memory (LSTM), artificial neural networks (ANN), etc.), CNNs are easily the most popular.<br>These convolutional neural network models are ubiquitous in the image data space. They work phenomenally well on computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, image recognition, etc.<br><br>So – where can you practice your CNN skills? Well, you’ve come to the right place!<br>There are various datasets that you can leverage for applying convolutional neural networks. Here are three popular datasets:

        	<ul>
        		<li> MNIST </li>
        		<li> CIFAR-10 </li>
        		<li> ImageNet </li>
			</ul>

        <p>
        	In this article, we will be building image classification models using CNN on each of these datasets. That’s right! We will explore MNSIT, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet to understand, in a practical manner, how CNNs work for the image classification task.<br><br>You can learn all about Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) in this free course: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) from Scratch.<br><br>My inspiration for writing this article is to help the community apply theoretical knowledge in a practical manner. This is a very important exercise as it not only helps you build a deeper   of the underlying concept but will also teach you practical details that can only be learned through implementing the concept.
